# Yaml file to install a DaemonSet that contains a device plugin for
# managing nvidia gpu devices. Expected to be deployed in Kubernetes
# clusters with nvidia gpu devices. On each node, the DaemonSet detects
# whether there are nvidia gpu devices, and if so, sets up the devices
# in ready state and report them to Kubelet through the device plugin
# interface. The device plugin simply sleeps if there is no nvidia
# gpu device on the node.
